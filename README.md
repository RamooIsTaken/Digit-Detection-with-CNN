# Digit-Detection-with-CNN
It aims to train a cnn model using data and then classify digits using the trained model

The CnnBuild.py file builds the Cnn model using the data set. The training-test-verification stages were carried out while the Cnn model was being created. 
Then the second file, videoProcess.py, loads the trained and saved cnn model, and makes an instantaneous figure estimate using the loaded model.
